**Credit Card Customer Segmentation Service Optimization**

Project Background
AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers.

Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the back poorly. This suggests that customers have a negative perception of the support services provided by the business or organization. This could mean that customers find the support services to be inadequate, unhelpful, slow, or lacking in quality.

Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customer queries are resolved faster. â€ƒ 2. Objective

Our main objective is to analyse the data to:

Identify distinct customer segments based on their spending habits and previous interactions with the bank by employing clustering algorithms.
Offer recommendations to the bank on improving marketing strategies and customer service tailored to these segments.
